The dataset is available at this link: http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/

The project was developed in python, using Google Colab to write the notebooks.

In the Google Drive folder (https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1c50pLd90fYLLflUXtrHQbDyzYm2_ZjFC) there are:

- the original data 'acllmdb_v1.tar.gz'
- 5.csv files (train_pos, train_neg, test_pos, test_neg, unsup) that represents the data after preprocessing

- the notebook 'Preprocessing'
- the notebook 'Classification'
- 3 notebooks for the topic modelling task (train, test, unsup)

- the report of the project (pdf)
- the presentation of the project (pdf)

To run the notebooks it will be necessary to create a link with the drive folder; so it will be necessary to modify the path at the
beginning (the initial cells).
